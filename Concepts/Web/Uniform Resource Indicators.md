What is a URI?
?
- URI stands for Uniform Resource Indicator.
- A URI is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular resource. It is a broader term that encompasses both Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names (URNs).
- URIs are used to identify and locate resources on the internet or other networks. They provide a standard way of naming resources to ensure uniqueness.

What is a URL?
?
* URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
- A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate and retrieve a resource on the internet. URLs specify the protocol used to access the resource (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), the location (domain or IP address), and the path to the resource.
- In simpler terms, all URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs. URLs are a subset of URIs that specifically deal with resource location.

What is a URN?
?
- URN stands for Uniform Resource Name.
- It is used to uniquely identify resources by name in a particular namespace. 
- Unlike Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which provide the means to locate and retrieve a resource, URNs are intended to serve as persistent and globally unique identifiers for resources, irrespective of their current location.
- URNs are part of the broader URI standard, which provides a framework for identifying and accessing resources on the internet.
- **Key characteristics:**
	1. **Global Uniqueness:** URNs are designed to be globally unique, meaning that no two URNs should be the same. This uniqueness is intended to persist over time and across different naming authorities.
    
	2. **Persistence:** URNs are meant to be persistent identifiers, providing a stable reference to a resource even if the resource is moved or its location changes.
    
- **Example:** An example of a URN is the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) for books. The ISBN uniquely identifies a book, and even if the book is moved to a different library or bookstore, the ISBN remains the same.

What is an example of a URI?
?
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular resource. Here is an example of a URI: `https://www.example.com/path/to/resource?query=value#fragment
- **Scheme:** `https` is the scheme, indicating the protocol used to access the resource.
- **Authority:** `www.example.com` is the authority or domain name of the resource.
- **Path:** `/path/to/resource` is the path to the specific resource on the server.
- **Query:** `query=value` is the query string, providing additional parameters for the resource.
- **Fragment:** `fragment` is the fragment identifier, pointing to a specific section within the resource.
This URI represents a URL, as it specifies both the location and the access protocol for a resource on the internet. URIs can also be used in other contexts, such as identifying resources on a local file system or within an application.
