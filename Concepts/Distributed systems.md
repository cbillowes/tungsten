What is a distributed system?
?
A distributed system is a system that consists of multiple independent entities, such as computers, servers, or nodes, that communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal. In a distributed system, these entities work together as a single, unified system, even though they may be geographically dispersed and connected through a network.

What are the key characteristics of distributed systems?

1. **Concurrency:** Multiple components in the distributed system can execute concurrently, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance.
    
2. **Lack of a Global Clock:** Distributed systems typically do not have a global clock that synchronizes the timing of all components. Each node may have its own local clock, leading to challenges in coordinating actions.
    
3. **Autonomy:** Each node in a distributed system operates independently and has its own local memory. Nodes may make decisions autonomously based on their local information.
    
4. **Communication:** Nodes in a distributed system communicate with each other by passing messages over a network. This communication is essential for coordination and sharing information.
    
5. **Fault Tolerance:** Distributed systems often incorporate mechanisms to handle failures in individual nodes or communication links. This helps ensure the system's robustness in the face of hardware failures or network issues.

What are examples of distributed systems?
?
Examples of distributed systems include cloud computing platforms, peer-to-peer networks, and large-scale web applications. Some characteristics of distributed systems make them challenging to design and manage, such as dealing with network latency, ensuring consistency of data across nodes, and achieving fault tolerance.

Why do we use distributed systems?
?
Distributed systems are employed to address issues like scalability, reliability, and performance by distributing the workload across multiple nodes. They are prevalent in various applications, ranging from web services and social networks to scientific computing and enterprise systems. #scalability #reliability #performance
