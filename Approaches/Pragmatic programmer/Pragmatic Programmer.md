Who wrote the book "The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery" and what is it known for? #books
?
Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. It is known for its practical advice and timeless insights into effective software development practices.

What does "tip of the iceberg" knowledge mean?
?
Developers should strive to understand the deeper levels of technology and not just the surface. This includes understanding the tools they use, the languages they code in, and the underlying principles of computing.

What is the DRY principle? #principles
?
Avoid duplicating code and information in a system. The authors stress the importance of maintaining a single source of truth to minimize errors and ensure consistency.

What is orthogonality?
?
Design systems to be as modular and independent as possible. Changes in one part of the system should not have unexpected effects on other parts.

What does "stone soup and boiled frogs" refer to?
?
The book uses metaphors like "Stone Soup" and "Boiled Frogs" to discuss the incremental approach to solving problems and avoiding complacency. Small, positive changes can lead to significant improvements.

What is the "broken window" theory?
?
Address problems and fix broken windows (bugs, bad code, etc.) immediately. Ignoring small issues can lead to a culture of neglect and deteriorate the overall quality of the codebase.

What is rubber duck debugging?
?
Explain your code or problem to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) to gain new perspectives and insights. This helps in understanding and solving problems more effectively.

Why would one want to advocate for loosely coupled systems?
?
Decoupling components makes the code more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changes.

What should we do instead of relying on coincidences and luck?
?
Be intentional in coding decisions, and thoroughly understand the tools and libraries used.

How can we use version control systems effectively?
?
Branching, tagging, and merging are powerful tools for managing code changes and collaborating with a team.

We need to be able to provide accurate and realistic estimates for tasks. How can we do that?
?
Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces for better estimation.

What should we do with the tools we use?
?
Master your tools, using the right tool for the job, and constantly seeking out new tools that can enhance your productivity.

What sort of documentation should you write?
?
Write documentation that is helpful, concise, and meaningful. Maintain documentation as the code evolves.

What is defensive programming and what can it help prevent?
?
Defensive programming is an approach to software development where the primary focus is on anticipating and guarding against potential problems, errors, and unexpected situations. The goal is to create robust and resilient software that can handle unforeseen conditions and external inputs without crashing or producing incorrect results. Always be vigilant and anticipate potential problems. Defensive programming helps prevent bugs and unexpected issues.

How can you continuously learn and expand your skills?
?
Treat knowledge acquisition as an investment that pays dividends over time. Read, watch and listen regularly, continuously practice, take courses, work on side projects, join challenges...
