Who introduced Extreme Programming?
?
Kent Beck in the late 1990s

What is the intention of the XP design?
?
XP is designed to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements through frequent releases, collaboration, and feedback. The methodology emphasizes a set of practices and values that prioritize adaptability, communication, and simplicity.

What is XP?
?
Extreme Programming is known for its flexibility and ability to adapt to changing requirements. It's suitable for projects where the development team and stakeholders can collaborate closely, and there is a need for rapid and continuous delivery of value. While not every project may adopt all XP practices, many teams find value in incorporating some of its principles to enhance their development processes.

What are the core values of XP?
?
1. **Communication:**
    - XP emphasizes open and frequent communication among team members, stakeholders, and customers. Face-to-face communication is encouraged to build a shared understanding.
2. **Simplicity:**
    - The methodology promotes simplicity in design and code. Developers are encouraged to avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on solving the current problem at hand.
3. **Feedback:**
    - Frequent feedback loops are crucial. This includes continuous integration, automated testing, and regular feedback from customers. Quick response to change is a key principle.
4. **Courage:**
    - Team members are encouraged to take risks, challenge the status quo, and make necessary changes to improve the project. Courage is required to experiment and innovate.

What are the core practices of XP?
?
1. **Pair Programming:**
    - Two programmers work together at one workstation. This practice encourages knowledge sharing, higher code quality, and a reduction in defects.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
    - Developers write tests before writing the actual code. This ensures that the code meets the specified requirements and allows for easier maintenance and changes.
3. **Continuous Integration:**
    - Code changes are integrated into a shared repository multiple times a day. Automated builds and tests help detect integration issues early.
4. **Refactoring:**
    - Regularly improving the design and structure of the code without changing its external behavior. This ensures code remains clean and maintainable.
5. **Collective Code Ownership:**
    - The entire team is responsible for the codebase. Any team member can work on any part of the code, promoting knowledge sharing and reducing bottlenecks.
6. **Small Releases:**
    - Frequent, small releases of the software allow for quick adaptation to changing requirements and provide value to customers sooner.
7. **On-Site Customer:**
    - Having a customer or a representative from the customer's side available on-site for direct communication with the development team. This helps in clarifying requirements and getting immediate feedback.

What are the roles in XP?
?
1. **Customer:**
    - Represents the business and is responsible for defining and prioritizing features. Actively participates in the development process.
2. **Programmer:**
    - Writes the code, collaborates with other team members, and participates in all aspects of development.
3. **Tester:**
    - Responsible for ensuring the quality of the software through testing. Testers work closely with developers and customers.
4. **Coach:**
    - Provides guidance on the XP practices and principles, helping the team to improve and adapt.
