Let's dive into its robust architecture!  
  
🔒 Authentication Gateway:  
The journey begins with the client interacting with the Authentication Gateway. This gatekeeper ensures secure user verification before granting access to the Telegram ecosystem.  
  
🔄 Load Balancer:  
Once authenticated, the Load Balancer takes charge, distributing incoming requests efficiently.  
  
🌐 Web Socket:  
The real-time magic happens at the Web Socket layer. This bidirectional communication protocol facilitates instant messaging between users, creating a seamless chat experience.  
  
💬 Chat Service:  
Messages travel through the Chat Service, the heart of Telegram's communication infrastructure. It handles message delivery, notifications, and ensures messages reach recipients without delays.  
  
👥 Group Service:  
For group chats, the Group Service steps in. It manages group-specific functionalities, ensuring smooth collaboration within communities.  
  
🔄 Session Service:  
The Session Service keeps track of user sessions, enabling users to maintain a continuous and synchronised experience across devices.  
  
🕰️ Last Seen Service:  
Ever wondered when your friend was last online? The Last Seen Service provides real-time information about users' online/offline status, enhancing the user experience.  
  
🔄 Relay Service:  
The Relay Service acts as a bridge between various components, ensuring seamless communication and data flow between different parts of the Telegram ecosystem.  
  
🗃️ Group Database:  
All group-related data is stored in the Group Database, leveraging caching for quick access to frequently accessed information.  
  
📊 Status Database:  
The Status Database holds real-time status information, allowing users to see who's online, offline, or away.  
  
🔗 Web Socket & Asset Service:  
The Web Socket interacts with the Asset Service, handling media and CDN-related tasks. This ensures efficient handling of images, videos, and other media files within the platform.  
  
  
In essence, Telegram's system design orchestrates a symphony of interconnected services, databases, and protocols, ensuring a responsive, real-time, and secure messaging experience for its users.
