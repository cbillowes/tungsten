What is ACID? #databases
?
ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. These properties ensure the accuracy and reliability of data in a database even in the face of errors, failures, or system crashes. 
ACID properties are crucial in database management systems to ensure data integrity and reliability, especially in environments where multiple transactions may be occurring simultaneously. These properties help maintain the accuracy and consistency of data, which is essential for the proper functioning of applications and systems relying on databases.

What is Atomicity in ACID?
?
This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all the changes made by the transaction are committed to the database, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged.

What is Consistency in ACID?
?
Consistency ensures that a database transitions from one valid state to another after a successful transaction. The database must satisfy a set of integrity constraints before and after the transaction to maintain data accuracy and validity.

What is Isolation in ACID?
?
Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions does not result in data inconsistencies. Each transaction appears to be executed in isolation from other transactions, even though they may be executed concurrently. Isolation prevents one transaction from interfering with another until the first transaction is complete.

What is Durability in ACID?
?
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects will persist even in the event of a system failure or crash. The changes made by a committed transaction are permanent and survive any subsequent failures.
