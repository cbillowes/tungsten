What are the fundamentals of system design?
?
Understanding these fundamentals will empower you to design robust and effective software systems that meet the requirements of performance, reliability, and scalability.
1. **Scalability:** #scalability 
	Design systems that can handle increased load or data volume by employing scalable architectures, load balancing, and distributed computing principles.
1. **Reliability:** #reliability
	Ensure system reliability by implementing fault-tolerant strategies, redundancy, and error handling mechanisms to minimize downtime and data loss.
1. **Availability:** #availability
	Design systems with high availability, minimizing disruptions through strategies like redundant components, failover mechanisms, and load balancing.
1. **Performance:** #performance
	Optimize system performance by considering factors like response time, throughput, and resource utilization through efficient algorithms, caching, and database indexing.
1. **Consistency:** #consistency
	Maintain data consistency across the system, especially in distributed environments, by using techniques like distributed transactions and consensus algorithms.
1. **Maintainability:** #maintainability
	Create systems that are easy to understand, modify, and maintain, emphasizing modular design, clean code, and documentation.
1. **Security:** #security
	Implement robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats by using encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
1. **Design Patterns:** #design-patterns
	Familiarize yourself with common design patterns such as Singleton, Observer, and Factory to solve recurring design problems effectively.
9. **Databases and Storage Systems:** #databases
	Understand different database models (relational, NoSQL) and storage systems, selecting the appropriate one based on the system's requirements.
1. **Networking:** #networking
    Gain knowledge of networking concepts, protocols, and communication patterns to design efficient and reliable communication between system components.
11. **API Design:** #apis
    Design robust and user-friendly APIs, adhering to RESTful principles or other conventions, for seamless interaction between different system modules.
12. **Microservices Architecture:** #microservices
    Explore microservices architecture to build modular, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
13. **Containerization and Orchestration:** #containerization
    Familiarize yourself with containerization technologies like Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for efficient deployment and management of applications.
14. **Caching:** #caching
    Utilize caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce the load on databases by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
15. **Testing:** #testing
    Implement a robust testing strategy, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system.
16. **Monitoring and Logging:** #monitoring  #logging
    Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track system health, identify issues, and facilitate debugging and performance analysis.
17. **DevOps Principles:** #dev-ops
    Embrace DevOps practices to automate deployment, testing, and continuous integration, fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.
18. **Compliance and Regulations:** #compliance
    Consider legal and regulatory requirements relevant to the system, ensuring compliance with data protection, privacy, and other industry-specific regulations.
