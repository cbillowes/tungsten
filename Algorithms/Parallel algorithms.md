What are parallel algorithms?
?
- Parallel algorithms are designed to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging the capabilities of parallel computing architectures.
- They involve breaking down a problem into smaller, independent tasks that can be processed concurrently.
- Parallel algorithms aim to improve overall performance and reduce execution time by dividing the workload among multiple processing units.
- Commonly used in areas like scientific simulations, data processing, and machine learning to efficiently handle large datasets and complex computations.
