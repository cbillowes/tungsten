What is bit manipulation?
?
- Bit manipulation is often used for tasks like setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits, as well as optimizing certain algorithms and data structures.
- Bitwise operations involve manipulating individual bits in binary representations of numbers. The most common bitwise operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). 
- AND and OR operations compare corresponding bits
- XOR toggles bits
- left shift multiplies by powers of 2
- right shift divides by powers of 2
