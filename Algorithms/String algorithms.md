What are string algorithms?
?
1. String algorithms are computational techniques designed to solve problems related to manipulating and analyzing strings, which are sequences of characters. 
2. Analogously, they can be compared to detectives analyzing patterns in a series of letters to uncover hidden information or find specific clues within a text. 
3. Just as detectives use various methods to extract meaningful insights from strings of evidence, string algorithms employ diverse approaches to extract valuable information, search for patterns, or perform transformations on strings of characters in computational tasks.
4. Examples:
	1. **String Matching Algorithms (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp):** Efficiently find occurrences of a pattern in a text.
	2. **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Find the longest palindrome in a given string.
