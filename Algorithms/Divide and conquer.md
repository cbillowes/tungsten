What is the concept of divide and conquer?
?
1. Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. 
2. First, the problem is divided into simpler instances. Each subproblem is then solved independently, often recursively applying the same divide-and-conquer approach. 
3. The solutions to the subproblems are combined to obtain the overall solution to the original problem. 
4. An analogy would be organizing a large group of people into smaller teams to efficiently tackle various tasks, with each team working independently before combining their results to achieve a common goal. 
5. This strategy is commonly employed in algorithms like merge sort and binary search.
6. Example: **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication**
