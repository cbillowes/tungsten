What are numerical algorithms?
?
- Numerical algorithms involve computational procedures for solving mathematical problems with numerical values.
- They encompass methods for performing arithmetic operations, solving equations, approximating functions, and analyzing numerical data.
- Examples include root-finding methods (e.g., Newton's method), linear algebra algorithms (e.g., matrix multiplication), and optimization algorithms.
- Numerical algorithms are essential in scientific, engineering, and computational applications where obtaining precise analytical solutions is challenging or impractical.
- Examples:
	- **Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:** Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
	- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Generate prime numbers efficiently.
