What sorting algorithms are there?
?
1. **Bubble Sort:** Simple but less efficient. Good for educational purposes.
2. **Insertion Sort:** Efficient for small datasets and partially sorted data.
3. **Selection Sort:** Simple but less efficient. Useful for small datasets.
4. **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity.
5. **QuickSort:** Another divide-and-conquer algorithm, often faster in practice than Merge Sort.
